# 🥚 Poultry App

**Poultry App** is a smart agriculture mobile application built with Flutter. It monitors **Total-Egg-Production** (e.g., Humidty, temperature, CO2) and uses machine learning models to **predict egg production** and **alert farmers** when environmental conditions become unfavorable for crops.

This app is part of a precision farming ecosystem, aiming to **increase the thir egg production **, and **empower farmers with timely, data-driven insights**.

## 📦 Features

* 📡 Real-time eniromental data acquisition via sensors
* 🔍Egg Production prediction using a trained ML model
* ⚠️ Alerts via vibration or in-app notifications when thresholds are breached
* 📊 Historical data visualization
* 🔭 Offline data sync support (optional)
* 🔐 Modular and scalable architecture using clean code principles

├── config/             # App configuration files and environment settings
├── models/             # Data models, entities, and business logic
├── screens/            # UI screens and widgets
└── main.dart           # Application entry point
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/poultry_app.git
cd poultry_app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash

## 🧪 Useful Dev Commands

* Format code:

  ```bash
  dart format .
  ```

* Generate freezed/json files:

  ```bash
  flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
  ```

* Analyze project:

  ```bash
  flutter analyze
  ```

## 📦 State Management

This project uses [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev) for managing app state:

```dart
final tempratureProvider = StateProvider<double>((ref) => 0.0);
```

Alternatively, GetX can be configured if preferred.

## 🧠 Prediction Engine

Enviromental data (CO2/Ammonium, temperature, etc.) is passed to a trained machine learning model, which returns one of the following:

* ✅ Optimum: Conditions ideal for egg production.
* ⚠️ High Risk: Parameters nearing harmful thresholds.
* ❌ Critical: Immediate corrective action required.


Results are used to **trigger device vibrations** or notify the farmer via the app UI.
